# Exploring Road Safety: A Deep Dive into the US Accidents Dataset

## üìä Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the US Accidents dataset, exploring patterns, trends, and insights related to traffic accidents across the United States. The analysis covers a 6-year period and provides valuable insights into road safety factors, temporal patterns, and geographical distributions.

## üéØ Key Objectives

- Analyze accident patterns across different time periods and locations
- Identify high-risk areas and contributing factors
- Explore temporal trends in accident occurrences
- Understand the relationship between various traffic features and accident frequency
- Provide actionable insights for road safety improvements

## üìà Dataset Information

**Source**: [US Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) by Sobhan Moosavi  
**Time Period**: 6 years of accident data  
**Features**: 46 variables including location, weather, traffic conditions, and accident details  
**Size**: Comprehensive dataset with 7million+ of accident records

## üîç Analysis Methodology

### Data Exploration
- **Data Profiling**: Comprehensive analysis using pandas-profiling for initial data understanding
- **Missing Value Analysis**: Identification and handling of missing data
- **Correlation Analysis**: Exploration of relationships between variables
- **Statistical Analysis**: Distribution analysis and summary statistics

### Visualization Techniques
- **Geographical Analysis**: Mapping accident hotspots and regional patterns
- **Temporal Analysis**: Time-based visualizations for accident trends
- **Statistical Plots**: Histograms, distribution plots, and correlation heatmaps
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts for better data exploration
- **Correlation Analysis**: Heatmaps showing relationships between features
- **Time Series Analysis**: Hourly and daily accident pattern visualizations

## üìä Key Findings

### üèôÔ∏è Geographical Distribution
- **High-Risk Cities**: Less than 4.5% of cities (494 cities) had more than 1,000 accidents
- **Low-Risk Areas**: More than 4,400 cities had less than 10 accidents over the 6-year period
- **Regional Patterns**: Accidents were more frequent in coastal areas, with central regions showing lower accident rates
- **Notable Absence**: New York City data was not present in the dataset

### ‚è∞ Temporal Patterns

#### Weekday Accidents
- **Peak Hours**: Most accidents occurred during 6 AM to 9 AM and 3 PM to 6 PM
- **Commute Correlation**: Peak times align with typical office and home commute periods
- **Pattern**: Clear bimodal distribution reflecting rush hour traffic

#### Weekend Accidents
- **Different Pattern**: Bell curve distribution with peak between 10 AM to 3 PM
- **Leisure Time**: Accidents concentrated during typical leisure and shopping hours
- **Opposite Trend**: Weekend patterns differ significantly from weekday patterns

### üìà Visual Analysis

#### Accident Patterns by Hour

*This visualization shows the geographical distribution of accidents across different US states, highlighting regional variations in accident frequency and identifying high-risk areas that require targeted safety interventions.*

### üö¶ Traffic Features Analysis
- **Traffic Signals**: Strong correlation with accident frequency
- **Traffic Calming**: High correlation with accident occurrences
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature and wind chill show significant correlations
- **Road Features**: Various road infrastructure elements impact accident rates

### üìà Statistical Insights
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive dataset with 46 variables for detailed analysis
- **Correlation Patterns**: Multiple high correlations identified between traffic features
- **Imbalanced Data**: Some features show significant imbalances requiring careful interpretation
- **Missing Data**: Strategic handling of missing values for robust analysis
